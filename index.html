        <p>This Website serves as tool for you to track your progression through Dark Souls 3 achievements. 
            It is based off the steam guide <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=668813993" target="_blank" alt="link to the guide on steam's website">"Ultimate Achievements Checklist"</a> 
            by user The_Blog. The Objective is to make a tool that allows easier tracking of one's progression through the game. 
            It is separated in two categories: the Simple Achievements, singular tasks or objective, like defeating a boss, these do not require more tracking than completed or not; 
            and the complex achievements, those with multiple objective, or stage of progression, such as collecting every ring available in the game. There's also a light guide that explains some of the achievement, but is not meant as replacement for any wiki or full guide, only simple reminders.</p>
