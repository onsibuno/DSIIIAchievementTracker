## What is DSIIIAchievementTracker ?

  This Website serves as tool for you to track your progression through Dark Souls 3 achievements. It is based off the steam guide [Ultimate Achievements Checklist](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=668813993) by user The_Blog.

  The Objective was to make a tool that allows easier tracking of one's progression through the game. It is separated in two categories: the Simple Achievements, singular tasks or objective, like defeating a boss, these do not require more tracking than completed or not; and the complex achievements, those with multiple objective, or stage of progression, such as collecting every ring available in the game. There's also a light guide that explains some of the achievement, but is not meant as replacement for any wiki or full guide, only simple reminders.

## Why make it, and what for ?

  I had the idea of making this while using the original steam guide for my own playthrough back when i started web development on my own, but using it as a .txt made it difficult for me to find things through the file so i had this idea of using html checkboxes and made a first version and quickly abandonned it as it was out of my understanding of html, css, php and whatever languages i had to learn for it to work.

  But i recently started a training course for web development and part of it is to make a personal project as a showcase of what we'll learn through the year. I decided to revive this project as part of my course.

## Current state of the projet

I am not working on this project anymore i went through to make a way to display if an achievement is completed and moving it to the end of the list. Though it still lacks a save system to avoid it reseting your progress every reload. There's also a start of a function to fully complete a complex achievement with a single button, but it's not working yet. There also is a guide page i was working on unsure if it had purpose, it's really incomplete and not really useful but it's there.
Simple achievments page also lacks most checkboxes and should be generated through javascript too.
