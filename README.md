## What is DSIIIAchievementTracker ?

  This Website serves as tool for you to track your progression through Dark Souls 3 achievements. It is based off the steam guide [Ultimate Achievements Checklist](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=668813993) by user The_Blog.

  The Objective is to make a tool that allows easier tracking of one's progression through the game. It is separated in two categories: the Simple Achievements, singular tasks or objective, like defeating a boss, these do not require more tracking than completed or not; and the complex achievements, those with multiple objective, or stage of progression, such as collecting every ring available in the game. There's also a light guide that explains some of the achievement, but is not meant as replacement for any wiki or full guide, only simple reminders.

## Why make it, and what for ?

  I had the idea of making this while using the original steam guide for my own playthrough back when i started web development on my own, but using it as a .txt made it difficult for me to find things through the file so i had this idea of using html checkboxes and made a first version and quickly abandonned it as it was out of my understanding of html, css, php and whatever languages i had to learn for it to work.

  But i recently started a training course for web development and part of it is to make a personal project as a showcase of what we'll learn through the year. I decided to revive this project as part of my course.
